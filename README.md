# COVID-19 Mobility Data 
This is a repository that hosts a subset of Apple's Mobility Data. This has been created to facilitate the forecasting of the effects of COVID-19 on transit activity across the United States. 

### Data

Data for New York City and San Fransisco â€” Bay Area: [CSV](https://github.com/Metaculus/Mobility/blob/master/Mobility_2020-09-22.csv), [Excel](https://github.com/Metaculus/Mobility/blob/master/Mobility_2020-09-22.xlsb)

### About [Apple COVID-19 Mobility Trends Reports](https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility)

The CSV file shows a relative volume of directions requests per country/region or city compared to a baseline volume on January 13th, 2020.

Day defined as midnight-to-midnight, Pacific time. Cities represent usage in greater metropolitan areas and are stably defined during this period. In many countries/regions and cities, relative volume has increased since January 13th, consistent with normal, seasonal usage of Apple Maps. Day of week effects are important to normalize as you use this data.

Data that is sent from users' devices to the Maps service is associated with random, rotating identifiers so Apple doesn't have a profile of individuals' movements and searches. Apple Maps has no demographic information about Apple users, so it's impossible to make any statements about the representativeness of usage against the overall population.

**Update interval:** daily
